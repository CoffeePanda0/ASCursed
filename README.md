# ASCursed
cursed image to ASCII generator made in python

  converts each pixel in an image file to an ascii character so when you zoom out on notepad it looks epic ~~and does not take a long time to run~~

this was written in less than 2 hours and is a mess

# Requirements
- Python 3.4 or higher
- PIL
- A stable mental state

# Usage
usage: ascii.py [-h] [-o [OUTPUT]] [-b [BRIGHT]] image
(-h, -O and -b are not needed to run). If -O is not specified, ascii.py will output to output.txt

Example:
python3 ascii.py -O duck.txt duck.png

Supports the vast majority of image formats
